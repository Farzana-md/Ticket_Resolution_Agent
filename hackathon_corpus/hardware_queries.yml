If you have a surge protector try a different outlet.Turn the system off and wait 30 seconds and then try again.Reach behind the machine and see if you feel air blowing out of the power supply. If you do, then you know the machine is getting some power.Look at the keyboard for the indicator lights being lit up as the machine boots.Sometimes the monitor has something to do with the system acting up. Unplug the power cord from the monitor and the wall and re-plug it. Unplug the cable from the computer to the monitor and re-plug it into the monitor. Try rebooting.Listen to identify a beeping series if there is one to report it to the technical help.If you have a tower computer you should see indicator lights just above the power button on the PC, if you see any numbers lit up report this to the Help Desk.Turn in all commts to the Help Desk.

If the document does not print from that program, the printing problem has to do with that program.
- - printer power,test page checked but printer not working.
  - Check to see if there is paper in printer. Is their a paper jam?If the printer has paper in the paper tray, the paper may be jammed or not feeding properly. Take the paper out of the paper tray and check to see that the top piece of paper is not crinkled or bent.If the printer is a DeskJet, lift open the front cover and look to see if a piece of paper is halfway fed through. If it is, remove paper gently from the top and close.If the printer is a LaserJet, open the top of the printer and check for paper underneath the toner cartridge. If there is paper there, gently remove it, and replace the toner cartridge.
- - printer power,test page ,paper jam is checked .Still printer not working.
  - Check to see if the computer getting a signal from the printer.The computer and the printer must be communicating before the printer will print. When you send a document to print, does a small printer appear on the Windows taskbar (down by the time)? If this printer appears on the taskbar, the computer thinks the printer is receiving communication. At this point, the printer should blink lights (if a DeskJet) or says "printing" or "receiving" on the display (if a laser printer). If the printer is not receiving the communication from the computer, try restarting the computer. After you have logged in, see if you can print now.
- - printer is not working,after solving the  power,test page ,paper jam,signal isssue.

A dialog box should open.If the printer is paused or offline you will see a black check mark next to the words "Pause Printing" or "Printer Offline."Left mouse-click on the black check mark and see if you can "uncheck" it.If the check mark will not go away, try restarting the PC (Start – Shutdown – Restart).Then repeat steps 1 through 7 again.If the printer is still not printing, please contact the Help Desk at x1112
- - printer not working after checking offline issue also.
  - Check to see if there multiple jobs in the Print queue.If the printer is a local printer (i.e., there is a cable running directly from the printer to the computer you are printing from), power off the PC, power off the printer, count to 10, and then turn both the printer and the computer back on again. Sometimes this will allow the printer to start printing again.
- - The printer is printing streaks on the page
  - If the printer is a DeskJet, go to the HP DeskJet Utilities menu in the Program menu. Choose the "Clean the Print Cartridges" option. If this does not work, try replacing the ink cartridge. If the new cartridge does not help the streaking, place the cartridge back inside the original packaging and save it until the other cartridge has been used up. This just tests to see if the ink cartridge is defective.If the printer is a LaserJet, try changing the toner cartridge. If the new toner cartridge does not improve the streaking problem, return old cartridge to the printer and place the new toner cartridge back in its original packaging for later use.If neither option works, please visit the printer maintenance vendor list to schedule printer service.
- - The printer in spite of everything is not printing?
  - Turn the PC off. If the printer is a local printer, i.e., has a direct cable hookup to the PC, turn the printer off also so both the PC and printer are turned off at the same time. After 30 seconds, turn the PC and the printer back on again. Try to print a Windows test page. If the printer still does not print, please contact the Help Desk x1112.

- - How to check Check to see if the CD scratched or dirty
  - CD, CDR, or CDRW drives read discs by shining a laser onto the CD and then measuring the amount of light that gets reflected back. Most of the time a small scratch won't matter.If the CD is dirty, you can clean the CD using a CD Cleaning kit or you can also use a mild detergent, like dish soap, and warm water, wash the CD and dry with a soft cloth. Once the CD is fully dry, insert the CD into the CD ROM drive and try to read it.If the CD is not dirty, you can try to clean the CD Rom drive using a professional CD cleaner kit.
- - how to check Check to see if the CD is a CD-R or CD-RW that was burned.
  - A number of older CD drives cannot read some types of CD-R CDs. Try using a different CD-R disk with a different dye under the reflective layer. You will have noticed that some CD-R disks are blue, gold, green, or even silver colored. Some of the colors have a lower light reflectivity value and an older CD Rom drive may have difficulty reading that brand of CD-R media.
